# Air Traffic Control Simulation
An example air traffic control simulation written using legacy C. This code is setting up the basic structure for an air traffic control system.
- Includes and Constants: Imports libraries and defines constants for runways, gates, airplanes, and mutex conditions.
- Arrays: Declares arrays to represent the state of runways, gates, and taxiways.
- Airplanes Structure: Defines a structure for an airplane with an ID and a thread ID.
- Semaphores: Declares semaphores for runways, gates, and gate queues to manage concurrency.
- Runway Initialization Function: Defines a function to initialize runways, setting all to empty at the start.

## Introduction

This is a walkthrough using Copilot for efficient C to Python code conversion, unit test creation, documentation, commit message generation, and performt efficiency and performance optimizations.

### Copilot Demo Walkthrough

This demo shows how Copilot can be used to convert C code to Python, generate unit tests, document unit tests, and generate a commit message.
